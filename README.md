taskerate
=========


This is an exercise for an HTTP rate-limiting module in the form of an
Express middleware.


[src/middleware.ts] contains just enough glue to delegate decisions to
[src/limiter.ts], which contains the rate-limiting algorithm.

To spin up an example server:


    npm install
    npm run start [port]


To use the middleware in your own app:


    const express = require("express");
    const taskerate = require("taskerate");
    const app = express();

    // 100 requests in the last hour (3600e9 ns)
    app.use(taskerate.middleware(100, 3600_000_000_000n));
